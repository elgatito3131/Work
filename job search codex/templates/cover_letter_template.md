Dear {{Hiring_Manager_Name or Hiring Team}},

I am applying for the {{Role_Title}} position in {{Location}}. I bring a B.S. in Computer Science (GMU, 2024) and hands‑on experience across the software development lifecycle, including unit, integration, and system testing, plus backend/database development with Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. I am a U.S. Citizen and eligible for DoD Secret clearance.

In roles and projects to date, I have:
- Delivered features and SOPs in Agile settings, improving team efficiency and onboarding.
- Implemented validation and testing (unit/integration/system) to ensure reliable releases.
- Built database‑backed web apps and RESTful integrations using modern tooling and Git.

This role’s focus on {{Top_JD_Keywords_1}}, {{Top_JD_Keywords_2}}, and {{Top_JD_Keywords_3}} aligns strongly with my background:
- Skill/Requirement → Brief alignment (e.g., Python/C# development, OOP, REST APIs)
- Skill/Requirement → Brief alignment (e.g., SQL, schema design, Oracle/PostgreSQL)
- Skill/Requirement → Brief alignment (e.g., SDLC, Agile, CI exposure)

Example impact:
- Patriot Hacks (Co‑Lead Developer): Led a 15‑member engineering team, authored SOPs, and validated features for >300 participants within 36 hours.
- Street Solutions (SWE Intern): Practiced SDLC with unit/integration testing and created technical documentation for cross‑functional stakeholders.

I value clear direction, reliable collaboration, and mission‑critical quality—principles central to {{Company}}’s work. I’m available for hybrid/on‑site work in NoVA/DC and open to travel for installations and test support.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to {{Team_or_Program}}.

Sincerely,

Farith Bascope
