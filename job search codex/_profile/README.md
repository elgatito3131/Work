This folder stores cross‑role profile materials you can reuse across applications.

Suggested files:
- `profile_notes.md` — skills, projects, achievements, constraints (location/clearance)
- `resume_highlights.md` — reusable bullet library with metrics
- `links.md` — portfolio/GitHub links (if applicable)

Keep personally identifying data minimal and consistent with your resume.
