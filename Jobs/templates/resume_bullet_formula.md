# Resume Bullet Formula

Action verb + context + tech + measurable impact.

Examples:
- Implemented X using Y to achieve Z% improvement (N users/data size).
- Automated X with Y, reducing time/cost by Z% across N teams.
- Designed and deployed X (Stack: A/B/C), increasing reliability/throughput by Z%.

Tips:
- Mirror JD keywords honestly; avoid over-stuffing.
- Prefer concrete numbers; if unknown, estimate conservatively and label as approx.
- Lead with outcomes; keep bullets to a single impactful sentence.
