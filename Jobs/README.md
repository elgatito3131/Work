# Job Applications Workspace

This folder holds role-specific application artifacts and a CSV tracker.

Structure:
- `tracker.csv` — log of applications
- `templates/` — reusable templates
- `<Company>/<Role>/` — per-role artifacts (JD, keywords, cover letter, etc.)

Suggested flow:
1. Create `Company/Role/` and paste the JD into `jd.md`.
2. Add `profile_notes.md` with relevant skills/projects.
3. Extract keywords to `keywords.txt`.
4. Draft `resume_plan.md` (bullets, summary, skills ordering).
5. Generate `cover_letter.md` from template.
6. Log the application in `tracker.csv`.
7. Add outreach/follow-up in `email.txt` and schedule a date.
