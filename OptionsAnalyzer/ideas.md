# Trading & Income Ideas

## Currently Active

---

## Similar Risk/Reward

### Swing Trading Stocks
- Buy/sell stocks over days/weeks based on technicals
- Capital needed: $1,000+
- Could extend current analyzer to suggest stock positions instead of options

### ETF Momentum / Sector Rotation
- Rotate between sector ETFs (XLF, XLE, XLK, etc.) based on relative strength
- Capital needed: $500+
- Lower leverage than options, longer holding periods

### Earnings Plays
- Options around earnings announcements (high implied volatility)
- Capital needed: $200+ per play
- High risk - stocks can gap either direction

---

## Lower Risk

### Covered Calls
- Own 100 shares of stock, sell calls against it for weekly/monthly income
- Capital needed: $5,000+ (need to own 100 shares)
- Capped upside but steady income, reduces cost basis

### Dividend Capture
- Buy before ex-dividend date, sell after collecting dividend
- Capital needed: $1,000+
- Small gains but predictable

### Index Investing + Timing
- Buy SPY/QQQ on dips using RSI/SMA signals from analyzer
- Capital needed: $500+
- Less leverage, longer-term holds

---

## Higher Risk/Reward

### 0DTE Options
- Same-day expiration options
- Capital needed: $100+
- Pure gambling, high probability of total loss

### Futures Trading
- Leveraged bets on commodities, indices, currencies
- Capital needed: $2,000+ (margin requirements)
- Can lose more than invested

### Crypto Swing Trading
- Apply same technical analysis to BTC, ETH, etc.
- Capital needed: $500+
- 24/7 markets, high volatility

## Non-Trading / Business Ideas

### Sell the Signals
- Package analyzer as a subscription newsletter or Discord
- $10-50/month per subscriber
- Need track record first (3-6 months of documented results)

### Paper Trade Publicly
- Post predictions on Twitter/Discord before market open
- Build audience with transparent track record
- Monetize through subscriptions, affiliate links, courses

### Backtest & License
- Rigorously backtest the strategy on historical data
- If edge is statistically significant, license to a fund or prop shop
- Or use it to get hired as a quant

### Trading Bot / Automation
- Automate the analyzer to execute trades via API (Alpaca, TD Ameritrade)
- Remove emotion from execution
- Requires more coding + testing
